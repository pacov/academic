**Teaching**

* [Digital Assets](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/teaching/digital_assets): formulate statistical arbitrage strategies as optimization problem and present the efficient solving approaches.

* [Traditional Assets](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/teaching/traditional_assets): statistical modeling techniques applied to [equity risk-premia strategies](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/blob/master/teaching/traditional_assets/module_risk_premia.pdf) that are built on [firm characteristics](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/blob/master/teaching/traditional_assets/module_factors.pdf).

* [Real Assets](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/teaching/real_assets): real assets modeling are pretty gruesome, but students interested in [real estate](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/blob/master/teaching/real_assets/module_real_estate.pdf) and [infrastructure](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/blob/master/teaching/real_assets/module_infrastructure.pdf) financing will learn how to automate and communicate results using [Excel](https://nacnudus.github.io/spreadsheet-munging-strategies/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/solutions/r-and-python/).

**Research**

* [OneSixtyTwo Labs](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/research): sparsity-based signal processing and statistical learning techniques.
