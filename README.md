**Teaching**

* [Digital Assets](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/teaching/digital_assets): formulate statistical arbitrage strategies as optimization problem and present the efficient solving approaches.

* [Traditional Assets](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/teaching/traditional_assets): statistical modeling techniques applied to [equity risk-premia strategies](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/blob/master/teaching/traditional_assets/module_risk_premia.pdf) that are built on [firm characteristics](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/blob/master/teaching/traditional_assets/module_factors.pdf).

* [Real Assets](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/teaching/real_assets): real assets modeling are pretty gruesome, but students interested in [real estate](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/blob/master/teaching/real_assets/module_real_estate.pdf) and [infrastructure](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/blob/master/teaching/real_assets/module_infrastructure.pdf) financing will learn how to automate and communicate results using [Excel](https://nacnudus.github.io/spreadsheet-munging-strategies/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/solutions/r-and-python/).

**Research**

* [OneSixtyTwo Labs](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/research): sparsity-based signal processing and statistical learning techniques.

**Courses**

* [Applied Corporate Finance](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/courses/Applied-Corporate-Finance). I created this course partly in service to younger analysts who may be tasked with implementing financial modeling at work. My experience is that students find these calculations difficult at the outset and struggle to get their arms around them. I provide detailed examples, work through the formulas and calculations and, for those interested, code to automate the calculations. I always advise young people interested in investment banking to learn some coding and hope a few might be motivated by my experiences. If you learn to code in an advanced language like [R or Python](https://rstudio.com/solutions/r-and-python/), it will open new avenues for your analytical work, will vastly improve your productivity and will protect the future of your career as forces of automation and artificial intelligence rapidly advance in our industry. Those not interested in the coding can simply skip the coding examples and focus on the spreadsheet.
