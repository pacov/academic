**Teaching**

* [Digital Assets](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/teaching/digital_assets): formulate statistical arbitrage strategies as optimization problem and present the efficient solving approaches.

* [Traditional Assets](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/teaching/traditional_assets): statistical modeling techniques applied to [equity risk-premia strategies](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/blob/master/teaching/traditional_assets/module_risk_premia.pdf) that are built on [firm characteristics](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/blob/master/teaching/traditional_assets/module_factors.pdf).

* [Real Assets](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/teaching/real_assets): real assets modeling are pretty gruesome, but students interested in [real estate](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/blob/master/teaching/real_assets/module_real_estate.pdf) and [infrastructure](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/blob/master/teaching/real_assets/module_infrastructure.pdf) financing will learn how to automate and communicate results using [Excel](https://nacnudus.github.io/spreadsheet-munging-strategies/) and [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/solutions/r-and-python/).

**Research**

* [OneSixtyTwo Labs](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/research): sparsity-based signal processing and statistical learning techniques.

**Seminars**

These seminars will be online and for curious students in the Dominican Republic to join, and since we are going to be covering financial models mainly (except for the [DELL LBO](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/seminars/corporate_finance/1_private_equity/1_cases/1_corporate)) on real assets ([real estate](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/seminars/corporate_finance/1_private_equity/1_cases/2_real_estate) and [infrastructure](https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/master/seminars/corporate_finance/1_private_equity/1_cases/3_infrastructure) mainly because of the PPP projects in infrastructure), I will try to find ways to keep students engaged, disciplined and interactive. For example, two weeks ago I had [Karl Polen](https://karlp-asrs.github.io/bio.html) as guest lecturer in my class at the [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/). Karl is the Chief Investment Officer at the Arizona State Retirement System and is responsible for the management of $\$40+$ billion in assets. 

My objective of sharing the course material below is not to provide prescriptive modeling lessons, but to instead provide students a menu of cases, with enough information to help them make the financial modeling choice that is best for the deal at hand.  Put simply, I can provide some structure for you to organize what you already know, and tools that may help you put that knowledge into practice. I hope that you do give one (or more) of my cases a shot and I hope that you enjoy the experience and get a chance to try it out at work.
Sincerely, Nico
