The importance of digital signal processing for feature engineering appears to be expanding at a tremendous rate, but one of the impediments in advancing signal processing research for computational finance is the lack of resources to handle the distributed nature of storing and analyzing data. At OneSixtyTwo Labs, we already house one [NVIDIA DGX-1](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-1/) system to compute and evaluate large collection of features using end-to-end analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. The techniques and applications of digital signal processing are implemented via a Python, R, and C++ interface to promote adoption by students. We are also facilitating students clean historical data for U.S. equities and digital assets along with state-of-the-art database technologies to accommodate ever larger and higher-dimensional data sets, as well as accelerated machine learning and data analytics libraries.
