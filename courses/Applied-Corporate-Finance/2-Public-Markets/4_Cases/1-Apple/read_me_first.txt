My experience is that students find accounting adjustments at the outset and struggle to get through them. The spreadsheet first gives an explanation of how each adjustment fits into the valuation model as a whole and then gives detailed explanations of all accounting formulas and calculations in plain English. With its intuitive nature and the cell notes as guidance, students are able to forecast how much cash Apple, for example, have available for stock dividends & buybacks. In class, I will provide detailed examples, work through the assumptions and approximations.
