It has never been easy to accurately assess credit risk. But it’s becoming even more difficult in an era of unprecedented government intervention and cheap money. Credit risk and interest-rate risk are increasingly intertwined. Companies look better and more capable of repaying their debts simply because overall borrowing costs are so low. In fact, cheap financing is a reason why companies are now borrowing money at a record pace. Aside from refinancing more costly debt, companies are using money they raise to pay dividends to their owners, buy other companies, and repurchase their own stocks. 

The cost of capital is a ubiquitous metric for corporate executives, showing up in almost every aspect of their job description. It drives investing decisions, helps determine financing choices, and affects dividend policy and valuations. That being said, cost of capital is often mangled and misused in practice, and it seems that rather than operating within a range that minimize the cost of capital corporate executives were making financing choices based upon perceptions of the cheapness (or costliness) of capital<sup>[1](#f1)</sup>. 

<a name="f1">1</a>: An excellent read by Robin Wigglesworth: In 1988 two corporate finance specialists wrote: ["Equity is soft, debt hard. Equity is forgiving, debt insistent. Equity is a pillow, debt a sword."](https://www.ft.com/content/87efe5a9-4cb6-493b-a31a-f9efd5ddd242) Today, many corporate executives are probably rueing choosing the sword over the pillow.

It is true that some companies and investors, especially those playing the leverage game in the pre-COVID economy, overestimated its benefits and underestimated its costs, and they are now learning this lesson the hard way. Unfortunately, for some of these businesses that debt will threaten their near future on growth and investment. For others, it will create opportunities and change in business plans as consumer confidence comes back quickly. To me the biggest lesson of COVID is to keep an open mind and to take predominantly a process risk approach.

For the past decade I have extended my lectures far beyond what is labeled as corporate finance, introducing students to some reproducible examples that show how calculus can be used to estimate the optimal financing mix for companies across industries and regions. Starting with how the market is pricing risk, and then moving on to differences across companies on the costs of capital. In this repository I updated the cost of capital and target debt ratios (optimal financing mix) for a total of 39,643 companies globally <sup>[2](#f2)</sup>, and what each company can sustain in debt as we change the current debt to capital ratio to a target debt ratio. To estimate the cost of capital at different debt ratios, I first estimated the cost of equity at each debt ratio, and then estimated the interest coverage ratio, synthetic rating, and cost of debt, taking care to ensure that if the interest expenses exceed the operating income, tax benefits would be lost.

<a name="f2">2</a>: I used data from trusted data vendors including S&P Capital IQ, Bloomberg, and a host of specialized data sources. In computing cost of capital and excess returns, I deliberately removed financial services firms from the analysis, because: (i) computing operating income or invested capital is a difficult, if not impossible task, at these firms. (ii) debt to a financial service firm is more raw material than capital, and determining what comprises debt is almost an unsolvable puzzle. 

The complications with estimating the optimal capital structure lie in two aspects. First, in the statistical problems with estimating risk parameters, and second, with the financial models built on these parameters. There is a way of estimating costs of equity and capital that is agnostic about the choice of models, but it leads to circular reasoning, at least in the context of valuation. Here, the cost of capital operates as an optimizing engine where the [price of risk is set by markets](https://rpubs.com/rafael_nicolas/crp), and it enters the cost of capital in two places. When estimating the cost of equity, it manifests as an equity risk premium, and in the cost of debt computation, it is a default spread. Both are set by markets, reflect investor risk aversion and change over time. 

We could also argue that these hurdle rates (cost of debt & cost of equity) represent benchmarks that companies have to beat to create value. That said, many companies measure success using lower thresholds, with some arguing that making money (having positive profits) is good enough and others positing that being more profitable than competitors in the same business makes a firm a good company. However, without considerations given to cost of capital, returns are only half the picture. After all, capital is invested in businesses and that capital invested elsewhere in equivalent risk investments could have earned a return. The composite measure of excess returns is what we estimate here.

Heading into the post-virus economy where there will be wrenching changes in most sectors globally, we may wonder why bother looking at the profitability and excess returns. After all, every one of the numbers recorded in this database will be dated, except for the required returns (risk premia) and hurdle rates. That said, I think it still makes sense to look at growth, profitability, reinvesting, and cash-returns, and the link between value and growth (with some firms adding value as they grow, some staying in place and some destroying value). I use this framework to examine how companies around the world, in different sectors, measure up. 

In an age where scaling up and growth seem to have won over building business models and profitability as the most desirable business traits, it is worth stating the obvious. The measure of a good business is its capacity to generate not just profits, but also to convert these profits into cash flows that investors can collect. If we needed a reminder of this age-old premise, this pandemic should have provided a wake-up call. In businesses that already had anemic revenue growth, low margins, and poor investment efficiency, the effects of this pandemic was far more devastating than in businesses with higher growth, margins and efficient investment. There is a reason why airlines, retail, and oil were suffering the most in the front lines of this pandemic and why technology and heath care were doing much better. 

>"To have a business that generates above average returns over a long period in a compounded fashion is against the natural order of things.  Only a small slice of all businesses and companies belong in that category. They are rare."

To summarize, investors like me, in the name of prudence, think that less debt is always better than more debt, and higher growth and margin businesses are best suited to emerge stronger in the post-virus economy. It should be no surprise that equity portfolios should benefit from an investment approach focused on low capital intensity companies driven by vibrant intangible assets. Intangible assets have some characteristics that distinguish them from tangible assets, including greater potential economies of scale and higher risk of obsolescence. Skillful investors may be able to identify higher margin businesses that will grow faster than expected, hence providing the potential for attractive excess returns.
