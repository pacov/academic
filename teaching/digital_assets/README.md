# Digital Assets

This course is about digital assets and statistical arbitrage strategy treated as a signal processing and optimization problem. To explore the multiple connections between quantitative investment in financial engineering and areas in signal processing, I will show how to capitalize on existing mathematical tools and methodologies that have been developed and are widely applied in the context of signal processing applications to solve problems in the field of portfolio optimization and investment management. Roughly speaking and oversimplifying, there are three main modules:

1.	financial modeling: provide the fundamentals of digital assets modeling and return predictability, as well as algorithms for the estimation of portfolio design parameters;

2.	portfolio design: present the problem of optimal portfolio construction, elaborate on advanced optimization issues; and

3.	mean reversion: reveal the theoretical mechanisms underlying the design and evaluation of statistical arbitrage trading strategies from a signal processing perspective based on multivariate data analysis and time series modeling.
