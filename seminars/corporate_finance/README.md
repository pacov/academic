My objective of sharing the course material above is not to provide prescriptive modeling lessons, but to instead provide students a menu of cases, with enough information to help them make the financial modeling choice that is best for the deal at hand.  Put simply, I can provide some structure for you to organize what you already know, and tools that may help you put that knowledge into practice, but I am incapable of profundity. I hope that you do give one (or more) of my cases a shot and I hope that you enjoy the experience and get a chance to try it out at work.
